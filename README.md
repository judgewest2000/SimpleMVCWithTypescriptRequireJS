# SimpleMVCWithTypescriptRequireJS
A simple example of using Typescript / RequireJS with convention based loading of JS per View (look at the code)

NOTE:
If you take a look at the _Layout.cshtml file you can see the custom loader just inside the Body tag.
When you click on the various links you can see (in Web Inspector) the code loading directly from the load-default-scripts.js file.  
The ts and js scripts are inside the Scripts folder.

Look at the KnockoutExample1.ts to see an example of using Knockout / Knockout Validation / Knockout Mapping with RequireJS / Typescript.

There's also small examples showing use of fat arrows (=>) for writing functions which are strongly types stored in classes and used as callbacks.
