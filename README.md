# SimpleMVCWithTypescriptRequireJS
A simple example of using Typescript / RequireJS with convention based loading of JS per View (look at the code)

NOTE:
If you take a look att he _Layout.cshtml file you can see the custom loader just inside the Body tag.
When you click on the various links you can see (in Web Inspector) the code loading directly from the load-default-scripts.js file.  
The ts and js scripts are inside the Scripts folder.

Like I said before, this is not feature complete or anything like that, just an idea on implementation.

Likely more will follow such as dynamic injection of view models via div tags etc...
